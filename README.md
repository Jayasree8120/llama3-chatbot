# llama3-chatbot


Smart Chatbot
This is a simple web-based chatbot application using Dash and the Llama 3 model hosted on Hugging Face. The chatbot allows users to input questions and receive responses generated by the Llama 3 model.

This application uses Dash to create a web interface for interacting with the Llama 3 model. Users can enter questions, and the app queries the Llama 3 model for answers, updating the chat history with each response.
